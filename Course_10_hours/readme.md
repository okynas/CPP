### Where its learned from:
Learning C++ from a beginner 10H+ [youtube course / video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQp1zzTwrIg&list=WL&index=24&t=23s)

### Theory:

C++ is:
- general purpose => all type of programs
- compiled => converted to another language so the computer understands it.
- case-sensitive => there is a difference between myVariabel end myvariabel.

C++ was created:
- 1980's
- simula (easy to understand) + c (fast execution) => c++ (understandable and easy to use. fast execution)

Source code compiles to machine code.
Source code is what you / i write, machine-code is code that is compiled and the pc understands.
